            <div class="ourStory"><p>Our farm lies in the Scottish countryside, surrounded by soft green hills, misty mornings, and fields blooming with heather and wildflowers. Just a short drive from town, you’ll find yourself in a place where the air is crisp, the bees hum lazily, and time slows down. We welcome visitors who want to see where real food begins — stroll through our gardens, meet the beehives, or taste lemonade under the open sky.</p></div>

        <div class="homeContent">
            <div class="ourShop"><p>Our shop is the heart of our Scottish farm — a cozy corner filled with the scent of wild honey, freshly baked goods, and handpicked fruits. Every jar and bottle you find here is made in small batches, using ingredients grown on our own land and nearby fields. We follow the rhythm of Scottish seasons: golden honey in summer, crisp apples and berries in autumn, soothing herbal blends in winter. </p></div>

            <div class="ourGrossery"><p>We are a small family farm nestled among rolling hills, where everything grows slowly and naturally. Our honey is gathered by hand, our fruits ripen under the sun, and our lemonade is made from pure spring water. We believe that real taste comes from patience and love for the land.</p></div>
        </div> 

        <div class="homeContent">
            <div class="ourZoo"><p>Our farm zoo is one of the most loved corners of our land — a place where animals live freely and peacefully among the rolling Scottish hills. Goats, alpacas, rabbits, ducks, and chickens share this space, surrounded by open fields and wildflowers. Each animal is cared for with warmth, love, and respect, growing up in a calm, natural environment. Here, every visit becomes a small adventure — filled with laughter, discovery, and the gentle rhythm of country life. </p></div>
